# CnM Minibook Tools #

The CnMbook is a tiny netbook with tiny everything: screen, keyboard, RAM.  It is also sold in the UK by Maplin as a 'minibook'.

But it runs Linux, and so invites a certain amount of customisation.  That's what this project is for.

**Important Note:** CnMbook is a trademark of CnM Lifestyle Electronics.  I am not in any way associated with the product or the company that makes it.  But I applaud them for their excellent work.

## Tools ##

  * Deb2Patch - convert a `.deb` file from Debian's mipsel port into `.info` and `.patch` files suitable for the software installer on the laptop.

## Tips ##

  * Always install the [root console patch](http://www.littlelinuxlaptop.com/software/Getroot.htm) before you risk anything else. It should get you out of trouble in case you break X11 and can't get back to the desktop.
  * RunMoreThan3Apps - how to run more than 3 applications at once (if you have enough RAM!).

## UPDATE: Disaster! ##

I seem to have bricked the f###ing thing.  Well, that was fun while it lasted...
