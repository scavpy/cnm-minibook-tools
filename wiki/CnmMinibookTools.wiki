#summary Introduction
= CnM Minibook Tools =

The !CnMbook is a tiny netbook with tiny everything: screen, keyboard, RAM.  It is also sold in the UK by Maplin as a 'minibook'.

But it runs Linux, and so invites a certain amount of customisation.  That's what this project is for.

''Important Note:'' !CnMbook is a trademark of CnM Lifestyle Electronics.  I am not in any way associated with the product or the company that makes it.  But I applaud them for their excellent work.

== Tools ==

  * Deb2Patch - convert a `.deb` file from Debian's mipsel port into `.info` and `.patch` files suitable for the software installer on the laptop.

== Tips ==

 * Always install the [http://www.littlelinuxlaptop.com/software/Getroot.htm root console patch] before you risk anything else. It should get you out of trouble in case you break X11 and can't get back to the desktop.
 * RunMoreThan3Apps - how to run more than 3 applications at once (if you have enough RAM!).
