The CnM Minibook is a cheapo, tiny-screen, tiny-keyboard netbook with 128Mb of RAM and 2Gb of flash storage (but you can insert an SD card for more "disk".

It has a <400MHz MIPS (little-endian) processor, and runs Linux.

This project is for tools to help with tweaking, improving and generally hacking the thing to make it more useful.
